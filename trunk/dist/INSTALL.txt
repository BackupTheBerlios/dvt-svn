Dvt:: - Dictionary and Vocabulary Trainer


1.1) Installing (Windows, Linux)

There is no installer yet. Just extract all files from the archive file 
(ZIP under Windows, tar.gz under Linux) to a new folder and double-click on 
'dvt'.


1.2) Updating (Windows, Linux)

Any lesson files produced by you are also saved to this folder, so when updating
Dvt::, just copy the 'lessons' directory from the old folder to the new one.


1.3) Backup (Windows, Linux)

To backup your lessons, just save the folder 'lessons' to your backup location.


1.4) Uninstalling (Windows, Linux)

Just delete the Dvt:: folder. Note, that all your lessons are lost unless you
did a backup before.
